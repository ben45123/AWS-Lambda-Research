# AWS-Lambda-Research

The purpose of this research was to compare hot and cold start times on AWS Lambda in Python, JavaScript, and Java to see which language is best for companies to run code on for the cheapest price possible. I ran the same simple code on all 3 languages on AWS Lambda and determined that after a cold start Python's execution time was 101.69 ms, JavaScript's was 58.34 ms, and Java's was 17.01 ms. For the same code using a warm start(code ran twice prior) was even more interesting, showing that Python's execution time was 86.68 ms, JavaScript's was 1.36 ms, and Java's was 1.23 ms. This was expected as Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be optimized by the Java Virtual Machine at runtime. On the other hand, Python and JavaScript, are interpreted languages. While they may offer ease of development, they can be slower in execution compared to Java, especially for tasks that involve heavy computation. Noting this however, the difference between Python and JavaScript was not expected.
